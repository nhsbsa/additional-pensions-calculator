              How would you like to pay for your additional pension?

          </legend>

          <p>You can buy additional pension in two ways:</p>
        <h4>Buying with a single one-off payment</h4>
        <p>You should pay the one-off payment to your employer and they will make the payment to us.</p>

        <h4>Buying with regular monthly payments</h4>

        <p>The regular monthly payments are deducted from your pay for an agreed period. 
          This can be for 1 year up to a maximum of 20 years or for a number of whole years until the state pension age.</p>

        <p>The start date of your payments are when your employer receives your agreement.
            You will usually pay the same amount each month. We will not take deductions from your pay until we confirm acceptance in writing. 
            Your first deduction will be more than 1 month because your employer will backdate it.</p>
         
            <h4>Difference in cost</h4>
        <p>If you buy additional pension with regular monthly payments, you will pay slightly more than if you pay with a single one-off payment.</p>
        <p>This is because we calculate the regular monthly payments based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the national pension age</li>
          <li>your age</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A single one-off payment is calculated based on your age. </p>
        <p>You can change your answers to affect the calculation result.</p>

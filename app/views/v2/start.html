        <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-normal"> This service is only for active contributing members of the 2015 Pension Scheme.
          You cannot buy additional pension to increase benefits from the 1995 or 2008 Schemes. 
          These schemes closed on 31 March 2022.

          <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-normal">Additional pension allows you to buy extra annual pension if you're an active NHS pension member.
            This will add to your annual pension payment when you retire.
          </p>
          <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-normal">You can do this by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a single one-off payment (lump sum)</li>
            <li>regular monthly payments for an agreed period. 
              From 1 year up to a maximum of 20 years.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You must complete all payments before your normal pension age. Your normal pension age is the same as your State Pension age or 65, if that is later. </p>
      <p>Additional pension can be bought at any time during the year. 
        This can be just for you or it can also provide benefits for your dependants in the event of your death. 
        It does not include an automatic lump sum on retirement, 
        but you can exchange some of your additional pension to provide a lump sum on retirement.</p>

      <h3>What should you do after you calculate your additional pension</h3>
      <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-normal">Once you calculate how much additional pension you would like, the calculator will give you a partially completed Election to purchase additional pension (AP1) form.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-normal">It will take up to 6 weeks to confirm your application for additional pension.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-normal">You should complete the form and give it to your employer or pension officer within 6 weeks of your calculation.</p>
<br>
      <h3>When to apply for additional pension</h3>
     <p class="nhsuk-u-font-weight-normal">If your birthday is in the next 6 weeks, you should wait until after your birthday. Then you can do the calculation and send it to your employer.</p>
